=== Module description ===
This module contains a Timer class which can be used to measure the time
taken when executing a block of Python code.

Timer is used as a context manager; run help(Timer) to see example usage
for this class.

import time
from typing import Optional


class Timer:
    """A Python context manager used to measure and output the amount of time
    a block of code takes.

    === Basic Usage ===

    Put the code to be timed inside a "with" block, and call the Timer
    constructor with a descriptive label for that code block.

    The code will be executed, and the amount of time taken will be printed.

    >>> with Timer('sum ints'):
    ...     sum = 0
    ...     for i in range(1000):
    ...         sum += 1
    sum ints took 0.00015279301442205906 seconds

    If you want to access the amount of time the block took as a Python value,
    use an "as" clause to give the Timer object a name.  It will have an
    attribute called <interval> that records the time taken.

    >>> with Timer('sum ints') as my_timer:
    ...     sum = 0
    ...     for i in range(1000):
    ...         sum += 1
    sum ints took 0.00015279301442205906 seconds
    >>> my_timer.interval
    0.00015279301442205906

    === Attributes ===
    label:
        A label to describe the block of code.
    interval:
        The amount of time the block took, or None when the block is first
        created.
